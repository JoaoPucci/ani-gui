# The checks must resolve this repository regardless of how they are
# invoked, and must not be redirectable by a stray environment.
#
# Both properties were broken in turn by the same seam. The library
# re-derived its own root from `$0`, which is meaningless once a caller
# has changed directory, so an invocation by relative path from
# `tests/arch` walked above the repository. Honouring an inherited
# `REPO_ROOT` fixed that and introduced the other half: `REPO_ROOT` is
# a common name, so any environment defining one redirected the check
# — silently, exiting 0 against the wrong tree.
#
# Only `ARCH_REPO_ROOT` overrides now, and callers hand the resolved
# root over under that name. These are the cases that pins it.
